1. There is the word “AI” in the name of the bot list, which means that the strategy parameters of the bot are entrusted to the intelligent system, which will be modified regularly according to the volatility, resistance, support etc. indicators of each variety.
2. There is the word no “AI” in the name of the bot list, which means that the strategy parameters of the bot will not be modified by the system during the running process. You can judge whether you need to manually modify the strategy parameters according to your proficiency in AntBot’s operation and the current market conditions. You can also switch the risk mode (conservative, stable, aggressive) to obtain the latest parameters recommended by the intelligent system for filling.

It is suggest to starting the AI bot for beginner.
