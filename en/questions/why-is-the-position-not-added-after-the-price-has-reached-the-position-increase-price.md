## Why Is the Position not Added After the Price Has Reached the Position Increase Price?

Different robots have different conditions for increasing positions.

First, check the running status information of the robot to understand the current running status of the robot.

Take the DCA robot as an example. The main reason why the position is not increased when the increased price is reached is that the Trailing Stop is set. For details, please refer to the usage of Trailing Stop.
