## How to Change the Margin Mode of Binance to Cross Margin Mode?

4 months ago[AntBot](https://www.antrade.io/guide/docs/en/author/antbot/)1 minute

By default, AntBot will **automatically switch** the margin mode to **\[Cross Margin Mode]** for you.

If some trading pairs are **not switched successfully**, you need to go to **Binance** to **modify** them individually.

The following are the specific steps:

1\.

2\.

**\[Cross Margin Mode]**: All cross positions under the same margin asset share the same asset cross margin balance. In the event of liquidation, your assets full margin balance along with any remaining open positions under the asset may be forfeited.

**\[Isolated Margin Mode]**: Margin assigned to a position is restricted to a certain amount. If the margin falls below the Maintenance Margin level, the position is liquidated. However, you can add and remove margin at will under this method.
