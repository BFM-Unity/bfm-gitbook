#### What is Hedge DCA? <a href="#d1njg3" id="d1njg3"></a>

Simply put, it is to openning a long and a short positions, to hold long and short positions at the same time.

Assuming that the price falls, the long order will continue to hold the position and the position will be covered when the decline reaches the seted ratio, then the short order will take profit when the decline reaches the seted ratio.\
On the contrary, if the price goes up, the short order will continue to hold the position and cover the position when the increase reaches the seted ratio, and the long order will take profit when the increase reaches the seted ratio.

This kind of two-way holding method avoids the shortcoming of one-way DCA in the one-way market, the account carries floating losses for a long time without profit output. In the case of two-way holding, one side is quilted and the other side fluctuates, and it will continue to make profits. This greatly improves capital utilization.

It can be said that Hedge DCA has brought the regression strategy to the extreme.

#### What is function of Smart T/P?

Smart T/P (Smart Take-profit)is a further optimization of the entire position take-profit. When the system position reaches 25% of the estimated total investment, and the price rises to the take profit point of the last order, it will trigger the last order to sell profit.

#### The pros and cons of Smart T/P

After turn on the Smart T/P, even if the current price does not reach the take-profit point of the entire position, you can still take the order and make a profit, which is especially suitable for staying in the swings market for a long time, after the one-side market.

If the price fluctuates near the last order point, you can turn on Smart T/P to opening a position in the last order, take profit in the last order, opening a position in the last order, take profit in the last order, etc., and make continuous profits in the volatile market.

However, after turn on the Smart T/P, when the price quickly returns to the entire take-profit point, the profit of the Smart T/P strategy is lower than the entire take-profit ; in addition, after the last order is taken-profit, the average position price rises, and the entire take-profit point is at It is far from the current price, which affects the entire take-profit cycle.

You can choose whether to turn on the Smart T/P according to the current market situation and your own needs.

Because the take profit method of Smart T/P is to settle PnL independently for each order asset, which is different from the way PnL is settled by the average price on the exchange, it will cause traders to understand and inconvenient reconciliation for futures.
