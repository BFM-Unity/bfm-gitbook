## What is Bullish Engulfing Patterns?

4 months ago[AntBot](https://www.antrade.io/guide/docs/en/author/antbot/)1 minute

Bullish Engulfing Patterns refer to a K-line combination in which a large or medium bullish candle suddenly engulfs a previous bearish candle, indicating that the bulls have taken over and the market is likely to continue to rise. This is a combination of what is known in the market as a bullish reversal signal. In different stages of trend, the Bullish Engulfing Patterns also have different market meanings. In addition, the Bullish Engulfing Patterns do not necessarily have to be a combination of two candles, but can also be a bullish candle engulfing several small bullish candles in front.

Application Strategies:

1. The price of the currency had a significant drop before and the main force may be leaving at any time.
2. The volume of transactions significantly increased before the formation of the Bullish Engulfing Patterns, indicating that the main force may have partially exited.
3. If the price of the currency continues to decline after the formation of the Bullish Engulfing Patterns, the downtrend is confirmed.
