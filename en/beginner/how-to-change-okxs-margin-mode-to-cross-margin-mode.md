## How to Change Okx’s Margin Mode to Cross Margin Mode?

By default, AntBot will automatically **switch** to **\[Cross Margin Mode]** for you.

If you encounter some trading pairs that are **not successfully** switched, you need to go to **Okx** to **modify** them separately.

The operation steps are as follows:

**\[Cross Margin Mode]**: Your position margin is limited to the value of the asset you are trading. When you are liquidated, your maximum loss is limited to the balance of that single asset in your account.

**\[Isolated Margin Mode]**: Open positions calculate margin and PnL separately. When you are liquidated, your maximum loss is limited to the margin of that position.
