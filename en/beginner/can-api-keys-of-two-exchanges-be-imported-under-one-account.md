## Can API-Keys of Two Exchanges Be Imported Under One Account?

4 months ago[AntBot](https://www.antrade.io/guide/docs/en/author/antbot/)1 minute

No, in order to make it easier for traders to understand and avoid confusion, the same AntBot account does not support importing API-Keys of two exchanges at the same time.\
If you want to change the exchange, you must first stop all running robots, delete the API-Key of the current exchange, and then re-bind the API-Key of the new exchange.
